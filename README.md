# Sealer
> Sealer provides a solution in the form of a **website where anyone can organize beach cleanup events**. And volunteers or even your average joe who are interested in joining beach cleanups can participate without any hassle. We also serve as intermediaries between trash recycling plants and the cleanup organizers so that the collected trash are handled properly afterwards.

## General Information
The world produces **300 million tons of plastic** each year, but **only** about **10% is recycled**. The rest is dumped, landfilled or escapes as trash into landscapes, lakes, rivers and eventually, the ocean. About **8.3 million tons of plastic** end up in the **ocean** every year, making up roughly **75% of all marine debris**. Due to this, over **100 million marine animals die** each year. In the past 10 years, weâ€™ve made more plastic than the rest of last century combined. And by 2050, the population of fish will be outnumbered by our dumped plastics. 

Around 15% of those marine debris usually end up back on our beaches, and when the tide is high, it is common that those trash can get carried back to the ocean. Beach cleanups aim to help this problem, but is often faced with issues such as sporadicity, since there are no dedicated platforms to host these events which also causes the events to be hard to find, since have to know what you're looking for on the internet if you're searching for beach cleanup events. Frequent organizers might also have a hard time tracking the history of cleanup events because of that lack of a dedicated platform. 

Thus, we decided to make Sealer as a solution for this problem.
